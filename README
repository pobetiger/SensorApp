NAME: SENSOR APP
AUTHOR: BEN SUNG HSU

DESCRIPTION:

This project is my first try with interfacing and detecting all the Sensors Available on an android phone.
It should provide a list of available sensors and a small investigator activity to preview the values on a particular
sensor in selected by the user. The program contains simple basic activity switching mechanism. The program should also
contain a method of displaying the data at a more human consumable rate. The program should also provide a
method of plotting of the sensor values.
